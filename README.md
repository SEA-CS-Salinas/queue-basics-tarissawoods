## Lab Description :   
Take a a list of Strings and store the Strings in a Queue and in a Stack.  Use the Stack and Queue to determine if the list of Strings is a palindrome.   A palindrome list would be a list that had the same words going forward as going backwards.  A B A would be a palin list.   A B C would not be a palin list.


### Sample Data : 
```
one two three two one
1 2 3 4 5 one two three four five
a b c d e f g x y z g f h
racecar is racecar
1 2 3 a b c c b a 3 2 1
chicken is a chicken
```

### Sample Output :
```
[one, two, three, two, one] is a palinlist.

[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, one, two, three, four, five] is not a palinlist.

[a, b, c, d, e, f, g, x, y, z, g, f, h] is not a palinlist.

[racecar, is, racecar] is a palinlist.

[1, 2, 3, a, b, c, c, b, a, 3, 2, 1] is a palinlist.

[chicken, is, a, chicken] is not a palinlist.
```
